              <h1>Overview of The Salem Witch Trials</h1>
      <p>The Salem Witch Trials were a series of hearings and prosecutions that took place in colonial Massachusetts between 1692 and 1693. The trials were triggered by accusations of witchcraft against numerous people, primarily women. The proceedings were characterized by mass hysteria, religious extremism, and social tension. Many individuals were falsely accused, leading to the execution of 20 people, mostly by hanging. The trials eventually ended as public opinion turned against the proceedings, and the legal system recognized the lack of evidence and fairness in the accusations. The Salem Witch Trials remain a dark chapter in American colonial history, highlighting the dangers of unfounded accusations and the influence of fear and superstition.</p>
